## CMS editor experiment

A little proof of concept for a travel blog hooked up with a cms

# Plans:
- Sidebar interface for editing (complete)
- Inline interface for editing (tbd)

# Technologies
- Nextjs - React
- Typescript
- Material Ui
- Styled components
- tinycolor2
- color thief
- React Redux Saga
- Firebase -> Auth and Firestore
- Unplash source
- Framer motion

# Cool things I did
- The background gradient behind the Main Content gets it colors from the image. So no matter what image is used, the palette will always be unique to that image. Also the colors are randomized to create different background gradients. Colors were grabbed from the image using color thief package
- I used framer motion for the Navigation and Main Content tilt animation and well as the bubble grow animation on the editor sidebar
